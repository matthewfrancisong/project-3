# TheHappyCouple

#### Project Description
Planning for a wedding can be a nightmare. TheHappyCouple to the rescue! This website is for couples who are planning for their wedding and need a solution to manage their guest-list. Our guest-list management tool helps you to build your guest-list, send invites and check who RSVP. Unlike existing wedding planner tools such as The Knot, we offer couples the service of planning their venue layout and assigning each individual guest to tables.

Feedback from our instructor that the website is not intuitive enough for our users.

#### Improved User Flow
To further enhance the intuitive nature of guiding users through the different pages in the website, we added a progress bar at the top of each page to show users what is the next task to work on.
